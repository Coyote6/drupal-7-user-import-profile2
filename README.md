This is Drupal 7 module that adds Profile2 fields to be available to the user import settings.

Based on code from this issue:
[https://www.drupal.org/project/user_import/issues/1957556](https://www.drupal.org/project/user_import/issues/1957556)

Thanks to all the contributors.  I just packaged it up and added one bug fix.

To install, just upload module and enable from the admin console.
